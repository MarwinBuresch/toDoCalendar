# toDoCalendar
a to-do list and deadline calendar

Lets say you have several projects that need to be finished within a certain amount of weeks, each project has it's own to-do list and deadlines. This tool lets you select a period which will then be displayed as individual days with room for to-do list items for each day and a summary of deadlines and projects.

  -users can select the amount of days (display date and weekday)
  -projects, to-do items
  -I totally want to use <details>
