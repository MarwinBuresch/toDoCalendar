# toDoCalendar
**a to-do list and deadline calendar, yaaaay!**

Lets say you have several projects that need to be finished within a certain amount of weeks, each project has it's own to-do list and deadlines. This tool lets you select a period which will then be displayed as individual days with room for to-do list items for each day and a summary of deadlines and projects.

  - users can select the amount of days (display date and weekday)
  - projects, to-do items
  - I totally want to use: <details> For individual projects, and maybe even a cool menu. Projectdetails basically. Also maybe even more stuff, for example a related interactive to do list.</details>

here is some code I would like to use:
```javascript
function myFunction() {
  var node = document.createElement("LI");
  var textnode = document.createTextNode("stuff I want to add to a list");
  node.appendChild(textnode);
  document.getElementById("myList").appendChild(node);
}
```
